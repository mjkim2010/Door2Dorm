### Project Synopsis
Door2Dorm is a safety and security enabling dispatcher for the Stanford community. Using modern application design and AI techniques, Door2Dorm will provide a more elegant user experience to [the current 5-SURE service](https://alcohol.stanford.edu/be-safe/5-sure) while also optimizing the distribution of 5-SURE resources to maximize the number of students that 5-SURE is able to assist. 5-SURE currently relies on an antiquated dispatcher system that is often faulty for students that need assistance. Students consistently complain about long waits and faulty phone service. Door2Dorm will revolutionize this process by creating an aesthetic user interface for students requesting services, dispatchers determining pickups, and 5-SURE volunteers taking students home. Door2Dorm will help Stanford students get home safely and securely.

### Our Brainstorming Process
We brainstormed for a week, generating about a dozen ideas that ranged from a cross-promotional business recommendation app to
a college planning project. The two final contenders were a collaborative travel app and an app for 5-SURE. While we believe
there is space to innovate in travel itinerary space and are itching to vacation again, we settled on the 5-SURE 
app because it has a much clearer scope. Compared to generally improving the ease of travel planning, our final selection is laser-focused
on upgrading what is currently a phone and walkie talkie-based dispatch service to a modern,
mobile app-based security platform. Also, we feel that this project, if successful, will improve the lives of Stanford students in the
years to come. We hope, as seniors, this can be part of our legacy.
